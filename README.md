- **Node.js**: Used for server-side functionalities (if applicable).
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform.
- **GitHub Pages**: Used for hosting the live site.

## Approach

Could not use any game engines. Googled and filtered through videos and techniques for game development in vanilla JavaScript. Had to use canvas api.

## Challenges

Throughout the development process, several challenges were encountered:

1. **Asset Loading**: Had to restart the project multiple times due to difficulties in loading game assets. Finally found and integrated free assets.

2. **Code Integration**: The game broke each time new code was added, leading to debugging and reworking various components.

3. **Player Input Issues**: Dealing with player input, such as character movement and controls, posed difficulties.

4. **Performance Lag**: The game experienced performance lag during game play, impacting the user experience.

5. **Collision Issues**: Implementing accurate collision detection and response proved challenging.

## Unsolved Problems

There are some unresolved issues in the game:

1. **Win State**: Currently working on implementing a better win state for the game.

2. **Game Crashes**: The game crashes a lot, and debugging is ongoing.
3. **Draw and Animation Failures**: Canvas is having a really hard time drawing and animating the sprites. Keeps giving me errors in console.
